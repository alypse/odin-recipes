    <h2>10 minutes for something this delicious?</h2>
    <p>These 10 minute peanut noodles are creamy, chewy, and delicious. This recipe only requires
        common Asian pantry ingredients that are not hard to find. </p>
    <p>My favorite noodles to use are fresh
        jajang noodles which I will go into detail about later. And for those who don’t like it spicy,
        just leave out the chili crisp.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g fresh jajang noodles</li>
        <li>2 tbsp peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>½ tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili crisp</li>
        <li>2 tbsp hot water</li>
        <li>½ tsp sesame oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by cooking your favorite noodles according to packaging then drain
            and make sure to save some of that noodle water for later.</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients into a bowl, then add 2 tbsp of the hot noodle
            water to melt everything together.</li>
        <li>Mix your noodles in, top with the garnishes and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
